## Objectives
* Students will learn about event listeners and jQuery

### Key Take-Aways 

* Students should have an understanding of how to write event listeners and their callback functions
* Students should have a basic understanding of jQuery and be able to write jQuery alternatives to the DOM manipulation syntax theyâ€™ve learned earlier

### Teacher Note

The basic concepts of event listeners and jQuery are fairly simple, so they should be able to be taught in one day. It should be made clear to students that jQuery is a library built entirely out of JavaScript - anything you do in jQuery can be written in vanilla JS. 

### Additional Challenges

Students should practice listening for a variety of events if they are finished early. Key and mouse events are very useful to practice.  Can they write an event listener that, when a mouse hovers over an element, the element changes color, or animates in some way?
